[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/kenburke/sortingAlgorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kenburke/sortingAlgorithms)

Example python project with continuous integration testing.

Examines bubblesort and quicksort complexity.

## usage

To use the package, first run

```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

to install all the dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Then the package's
main function (located in `sortingComplexity/__main__.py`) can be run as follows

```
python -m sortingComplexity
```

## testing

Testing is as simple as running

```
python -m pytest
```

from the root directory of this project.

## interactive

This homework comes with a Jupiter notebook in `sortingAlgorithms.ipynb`.
